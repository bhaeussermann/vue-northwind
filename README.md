# Northwind

This is a simple CRUD application for managing the Employees in a standard Northwind database. It is hosted 
[here](https://vue-northwind.up.railway.app/) as a quick preview.

The application interfaces with a [REST service hosted via Express in Node.js](https://github.com/bhaeussermann/northwind-api).

It connects to where the API is hosted [here](https://northwind-api.up.railway.app/swagger/) by default, but this can be changed
in `vue.config.js` if you're hosting the API yourself.
